        <p>Objective: Sorting algorithms organize data in a predetermined order, usually either ascending or descending, to enhance accessibility, analysis, or decision-making processes.</p>
        <h3>Methods of Sorting</h3>
        <h4>1. Comparison-based Sorting</h4>
        <p>This method involves comparing pairs of elements and rearranging them accordingly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bubble Sort:</strong> Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements until the entire list is sorted; it is straightforward but not very efficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Quick Sort:</strong> Partitions the dataset and sorts each partition recursively; it is highly efficient for large datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Merge Sort:</strong> Divides the dataset into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2. Non-comparison-based Sorting</h4>
        <p>This approach manipulates elements based on their inherent properties, such as digit positions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Counting Sort:</strong> Counts the occurrences of each element to determine their final positions.</li>
            <li><strong>Radix Sort:</strong> Sorts numbers by processing each digit from the least significant to the most significant.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Practical Applications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>E-commerce: Organizing products based on price, ratings, or popularity.</li>
            <li>Databases: Facilitating efficient data retrieval through sorted tables.</li>
            <li>Event Management: Arranging attendees in alphabetical order for streamlined registration.</li>
            <li>Operating Systems: Prioritizing processes based on their importance.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Searching Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Objective: Searching algorithms are designed to find a specific element or a subset within a dataset. The efficiency of these algorithms varies depending on whether the data is sorted or unsorted.</p>
        <h3>Methods of Searching</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Linear Search (Sequential Search):</strong> This method examines each element sequentially.</li>
            <li><strong>Binary Search:</strong> This method splits the sorted dataset into halves and is applicable only to sorted data.</li>
            <li><strong>Hashing:</strong> Utilizes a hash function to associate keys with indices, allowing for direct access.</li>
            <li><strong>Graph-based Search:</strong> Utilized for the exploration of nodes or paths within networks (e.g., DFS, BFS).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Real-World Applications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Search Engines: Retrieving web pages that correspond to a specific query.</li>
            <li>Navigation Systems: Identifying the shortest paths through graph-based algorithms.</li>
            <li>Libraries/Archives: Finding books or documents via indexing.</li>
            <li>Cybersecurity: Searching for vulnerabilities during network scans.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Relationship Between Sorting and Searching</h3>
        <p>Sorting is frequently a necessary step for effective searching. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Binary Search mandates sorted data.</li>
            <li>Sorting prior to searching can enhance the efficiency of repetitive queries, such as those in databases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example of Real-World Application:</strong> In an online library, books are organized by titles, authors, or genres to facilitate easier browsing. A search algorithm is employed to quickly locate a specific book.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact on the Real World:</strong> Sorting and searching algorithms are fundamental to numerous technologies, ranging from simple phone directories to extensive cloud-based systems. They play a crucial role in data processing, enabling swift decision-making and real-time results in our contemporary, data-centric environment.</p>
